// This is a basic Flutter widget test.
//
// To perform an interaction with a widget in your test, use the WidgetTester
// utility in the flutter_test package. For example, you can send tap and scroll
// gestures. You can also use WidgetTester to find child widgets in the widget
// tree, read text, and verify that the values of widget properties are correct.

import 'package:sqflite_common_ffi/sqflite_ffi.dart'; // Import for ffi

void main() {
  sqfliteFfiInit(); // Initialize FFI
  databaseFactory = databaseFactoryFfi; // Set database factory for tests

  // No tests for now, as the original test is not applicable to the modified app.
}

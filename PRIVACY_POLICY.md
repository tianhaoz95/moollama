# Privacy Policy for Moollama

This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which Moollama (the "Application") operates. This policy applies solely to the Application and its functionalities.

## A Commitment to Privacy

We have built the Moollama mobile application with a fundamental commitment to user privacy. The core functionality of this application is designed to operate entirely on your device.

## Information Collection and Use

We do not collect any personal data or usage information from you.

The AI models and all processing for the Application run exclusively on your device. As a result, no data, including your text inputs, generated content, or any usage information, is ever transmitted to our servers or any third-party servers. Your interactions with the Application are kept private and local to your device.

## Log Data

Since the Application does not connect to any servers, no log data is collected.

## Cookies

The Application does not use cookies.

## Third-Party Services

This Application does not use any third-party services for data collection or analytics. Because the Application is entirely local, there is no need to share your information with any external services.

## Security

The security of your personal information is paramount. While we do not collect any of your data, the fact that all processing occurs on your device provides the highest level of data protection. Your data is never at risk of being compromised in transit or on our servers because it never leaves your device.

## Links to Other Sites

This Application may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted.

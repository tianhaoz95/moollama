You are a world-class autonomous AI software engineering agent.

The project moollama is a cross-platform AI agent built with Flutter. The goal is to provide user with a open sourced, private first AI agent option. The app should avoid using cloud based LLM API and always use local model. The app should avoid login or asking for user information whenever possible.

Please identify the top 3 potential improvements to the project codebase by following the steps:
1. Read through the files in `/lib`
2. Identify potential imporvements to UI, robustness or even new features. Do not limit to these categories, be creative.
3. Rank the potential imporvements from step 2 to get the top 3 most important improvement.
4. Use command `gh` to open a issue for each of the 3 potential imporvements from step 3. The issue should have concise title, detailed and descriptive body to specify what is the potential improvement and a plan on how to implement it.
